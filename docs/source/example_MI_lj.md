# Mold integration for 100 plane of the fcc crystal for the Lennard-Jones potential

Here we provide a detailed set of instructions to reproduce the crystal fluid interfacial free energy using the Broughton and Gilmer Lennard-Jones potential (CELAVING package available [here](https://github.com/demonico85/cleaving/tree/master)) and `square/well pair_style` available in LAMMPS.

The data file (`mold_100.lmp`) and LAMMPS script (`lj_moldint.in`) are provided in the directory `/examples/lj_mold/` (see [here](https://github.com/AndresRTejedor/Mold/tree/main/example/lj_mold)), but in this worked example we will navigate through these files to explain them in detail.

The mold integration technique consists of different steps and here we only discuss the last two steps to obtain the interfacial free energy of the 100 plane for the LJ particles at $T^\ast=0.617$ and $p^\ast=-0.02$. All the steps can be found in {footcite:t}`espinosa2014mold`, and they can be summarized as: 

1. Preparation of the configuration by embedding the mold coordinates (from a crystal configuration with the equilibrium density and the perfect crystal lattice) into the fluid at coexistence conditions.
2. Choice of the [optimal well radius](#optimal-radius-calculation) $r_{w,0}$ to extrapolate the interfacial free energy.
3. [Thermodynamic integration](#thermodynamic-integration) to calculate the interfacial free energy for different well radii above the optimal radius
  $\gamma(r_{w,0}>r_w)$. 
4. Extrapolation of the interfacial free energy to the optimal radius $r_{w,0}$.

The configuration (step 1) can be easily created using the bulk liquid and crystal configurations at the corresponding $(p,T)$ conditions. In this example, we provide the system data file for the plane 100 of the fcc crystal lattice for a LJ system at $T^\ast=0.617$ and $p^\ast=-0.02$:

## Optimal radius calculation 

The calculation of the optimal well radius for extrapolation of the interfacial free energy includes the following steps:

1. Create a directory sweeping different radii ($r_w=0.27,\ 0.28,\ \ldots,0.33,0.34\sigma$).
2. For each radius one needs to run independent trajectories with different initial velocities. Create 10 directories for each radius directory (1 for each trajectory).
3. Copy the LAMMPS script file (`lj_mold.in`) in each subdirectory along with the configuration file (`mold_100.lmp`).
4. The LAMMPS script contains several variables that it is important to know to properly perform the simulations:
```
# ---------------------------- Define variables --------------------------------
variable  nts          equal  400000     # production number of time-steps

```
For this step, the typical run must be approximately 200000 time-steps (with dt=1e-3), and that can be controlled by the parameter `nts`. 
Regarding the interaction potential, the parameter `rw` stands for the well radius so this must be changed for the different studied radii during this step `rw`=$0.27,\ 0.28,\ \ldots,0.33,0.34\sigma$. 
The parameter `nkT` gives the well depth in $k_{B}T$ units and for this step we use 8$k_BT$, although any value that guarantee that all the wells are filled can be also used. 
Regarding the velocity seed, the variable `seed` controls this aspect, and thus, it must be changed with a random integer number for each simulation. 
Also, there are some variables that might be interesting to know:
- `thermoSteps` gives the number of timesteps to print the thermo
- `restartSteps` indicates the frequency of saving the restart files
- `dumpSteps` is the number of steps to save the trajectory in the dump file and for this step it is recommended to be set to 2000 (be aware that low values of this parameter can produce large trajectory files).

5. Launch the simulation for each radius and seed. That means a total of 80 simulations, but they are quite short. 

6. The analysis of this step consists in determining if there is induction time, *i.e.* further energy is required for the formation of the interface (see {footcite:t}`espinosa2014mold`). 
To do so, we recommend analyzing the resulting trajectory using the order parameter ${\bar{q}}_6$ ({footcite:t}`lechner2008accurate`) to determine the number of crystal-like particles in the slab. 
The recommended values for such analysis is a threshold of ${\bar{q}}_6=0.34$, and a cutoff of $1.35\sigma$. As a result, one obtains different curves for the order parameter as a function of time for the different well radii:

![Step-1\label{kk}](../figs/Fig2.png "q6_time")

Following {footcite:t}`espinosa2014mold`, one equivalent analysis consist in calculating the free energy profile:

$$\Delta G/k_B T=-log(P(n_s))+constant,$$

where $P(n_s)$ is the probability distribution of finding a cluster with size $n_s$ that can be straightforwardly estimated from the order parameter curves. 

![Step-1\label{kk}](../figs/FigDG.png "Denergy")

Therefore, in this case we can consider $r_w=0.32\sigma$ as the optimal radius with not sufficiently long induction time.

## Thermodynamic integration 

Once the optimal well radius is estimated, the next step consists in performing thermodynamic integration of the different radii above the optimal value of $r_w$. The calculation of the interfacial free energy for the different well radii includes the following steps:

1. Create a directory for each radius to be integrated ($r_w=0.33,0.34,0.35\sigma$) and in each directory, create a for each well depth considered for the calculation. This is a truncated range of values of $\epsilon$ in $k_{B}T$. A system can be considered to be integrated if the of crystal-like particles does not grow irreversibly (*e.g.* $r_w\geq 0.33$).

```

2. Copy the LAMMPS script file (`lj_mold.in`) in each subdirectory along with the configuration file (`mold_100.lmp`).

3. The variables of the LAMMPS script presented in previous section need to be changed slightly. For this step, the typical run must be of the order of hundreds of thousands time-steps (with `dt=1e-3`), controlled by the parameter `nts` (*e.g.* `nts=500000`). 
Regarding the interaction potential, the parameter `rw` that controls the well radius must be changed for the different radii `rw=0.33,0.34,0.35` (in $\sigma$). 
The parameter `nkT` (well depth) must change it for each simulation with the corresponding value. 
Also, the `thermoSteps` should have a reasonable value (1000 is recommended), and `dumpSteps` can be set above 50000 timesteps as the trajectory is not needed for this step.

4. Launch the simulation for each radius and well depth. 

5. The `thermo_style` is configured to show some magnitudes that are crucial for the thermodynamic integration. 
We need to get the average number of well occupancy for each value of `nkT` so that we print the potential contribution due to LJ particle-well interaction (`c_1`, column 13), but also the number of particles in the system (`v_nall`, column 15) since the energy is expressed in reduced LJ units, *i.e.* energy per particle instead of energy of the total system:

```
# ------------- Output thermo information and averaged variables ---------------
variable well equal c_1*count(all)
variable nall equal count(all)
compute mytemp melt temp
compute 1 all pair square/well
thermo    ${thermoSteps}
thermo_style  custom step pe epair press ke c_mytemp lx ly lz pxx pyy pzz c_1 v_well v_nall spcpu density
```


````{note}
For real units the multiplication by the number of particles in the system is not necessary.
````

Please note that using reduced LJ units the temperature must be rescaled so LAMMPS does not consider the well particles to thermalize the system. 

The calculation of the well occupancy for each depth can be easily estimated by taking the average over all the simulation of this value:

$$\langle N_w \rangle=c_1\cdot n_{all}/(nkT\cdot T)$$


````{note}
Please note that the system requires a time to equilibrate so that the analysis must be performed after $t\approx10\tau$. This equilibration time may vary depending on the system under study (water, hard-spheres, saltâ€¦).
````

In the following figure the curves of well occupancy vs. well depth for the different radii are presented.

![Step-2\label{Occupancy}](../figs/Fig3.png)

## Extrapolation for calculating the interfacial free energy

After the analysis in the previous step, one can obtain a curve of well occupancy vs well depth for each radius so that the interfacial free energy is calculated as

$$\gamma(r_w )=\frac{1}{2l^2 } \left[N_w\cdot\epsilon_{max}-\int_{\epsilon_0}^{\epsilon_{max}}d\epsilon\, \langle N_w(\epsilon)\rangle \right],$$
where $N_w$ is the total number of wells and $l$ is the short side of the box that can be obtained from the thermo (`lx`, `ly`, columns 7 and 8 int the `thermo`, as $l_x=l_y$ in this example). The resulting values for the integrals are provided in the following table (please note that the energy is now expressed in LJ units instead of $k_BT$ ($\epsilon_{LJ}=0.617\cdot\epsilon_{k_BT}$)):


|         $r_w/\sigma$)        |  0.33 |  0.34 |  0.35 |
|:----------------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| $\gamma/\sigma^{-2}\epsilon$ | 0.363 | 0.357 | 0.348 |

To obtain the interfacial free energy, you now shall extrapolate the value of the interfacial free energy to the optimal well radius ($r_{w,0}=0.32\sigma$) using a linear fit. 
According to the interfacial free energies as a function of the well radii provided in the table, the final estimate for the interfacial free energy is

$$\gamma=0.370(8) \epsilon\sigma^{âˆ’2}$$

![Step-3](../figs/Fig4.png "Extrapolation")

The calculation from mold integration technique reported for the same system from {footcite:t}`espinosa2014mold` provided an interfacial free energy of $\gamma=0.372(8) \epsilon\sigma^{âˆ’2}$ extrapolating to an optimal radius of $r_{w,0}=0.315\sigma$. 
Additionally, another work using the cleaving technique ({footcite:t}`davidchack2003direct`) reported a value of $\gamma=0.371(3) \epsilon\sigma^{âˆ’2}$ for the same system.
